**PLAN COMPLETED**
==remember to configure dockerfile==

Inside Every challenge there will be:
1. bash_rc : runs as soon as user is logged in
2. challengeFile
3. dockerfile
4. build script

build script + challengeFile -> dockerfile -> bash_rc

* before setting bash_rc remember to complete the docker configuration. i.e., docker build etc...
* make build executable - done!

Preserver configuration:
docker image build . -t challenge$i     #builds image  => done

bash_rc commands:
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash challenge$i             #creates container from that image

#ISSUES (Solved)
i) ./build.sh not running - solved
ii) opening bash script - done
iii) adding docker to groups repeatedly - cron?
iv) Better prompt? - got it!
v) Complete exit from server? - YESS!! done
vi) Script for user creation..necessary? - dudududone!
vii) Ctrl Z for exiting docker? - nope!
